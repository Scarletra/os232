1. [Operating Systems ](https://os.vlsm.org/ "os.vlsm.org") - A website for learning Operating Systems class. It provides all resources and tasks that we need to do or learn. <br><br>
2. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ "freecodecamp.org") - Website for everyone who wants to learn programming. It serves many courses with different subject and also beginner-friendly courses. Some of the courses are free to applied and the rest, we need to pay for it. <br><br>
3. [SCeLE](https://scele.cs.ui.ac.id/ "scele.cs.ui.ac.id") - Website to control most of computer science academic activity. Lecturers and students share all assignnments or other tasks here. <br><br>
4. [PicoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org/ "pico.ctf.org") - Website to learn or compete in Cyber Security things. You can practice with PicoGYM and many more features provided for cyber security learner. It also gives some challenges which will give you points for your account
5. [File Allocation Methods-Linked Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI3MACfFfFc) - In Data Structure course we learnt about linked-list; which every element of the list is placed scatteredly in the memory. Well, we can use such method as well to allocate our files. Here is a visualization of how files are kept using Linked Allocation.
6. [Contiguous Memory Allocation](https://binaryterms.com/contiguous-memory-allocation-in-operating-system.html) - Quoting from the content “Contiguous memory allocation is a memory allocation method that allocates a single contiguous section of memory to a process or a file.” But how to process those files exactly? How an operating system manage the fragmantations?
7. [All about trashing](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os.html) - Trashing is somekind of state when our CPU utilization is going to be reduced due to our operating system activity that has to spend more time to do swapping. In this case, we have to apply either global page replacement or local page replacement
8. [Process vs Program](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-program-and-process/) - We have learned about process and program, but what is the differences between those two things?
9. [Mutex? What is it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvF3AsTglUU) - In synchronization, there is a locking mechanism called as mutex. Well, in mutex, there is somekind of ownership, that allows the owner (thread or process) to release the lock/mutex. For further understanding, check out this video!
10. [Deadlock](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/) - We know that deadlock is something we avoid the most. But sometimes we don’t know what to do and how to avoid such thing. Let’s check this article to solve your ‘deadly’ problem.
11. [Difference between wait() and sleep()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036754/difference-between-wait-and-sleep) - So, we have learned about wait() and sleep(), but what are the differences between both of them actually, since for a glimpse, bot of them seems the same things. So, after reading the forum, I suppose the difference is that wait() can be “woken up” yet sleep can’t.
12. [All about Malware](https://www.malwarebytes.com/malware/#what-is-the-history-of-malware) - There are probability that our devices contain malware. But, there is also a huge probability that we don’t realise it. Malware could be detected by looking at some symptoms at our devices. What are those and how to remove them? We can learn all of those things by looking at this site. This site not only tells us about malware on computer OS, yet it also tells us about some tips on handling malware on our smartphones.
